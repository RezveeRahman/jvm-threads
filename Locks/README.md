## The different Locks
The locks in this project should not be used in real application. Partly
because it is more of a demonstration rather than something hard coded.
Also, these algorithm shouldn't be used in modern architecture. There
are some problems with these locking algorithms, such as deadlocks,
livelocks, mutual exclusion and so on.
